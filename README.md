# CAPSTONE PROJECT - UDACITY FEND COURSE

## INTRODUCTION

This is the final project of the UDACITY Front End Developer course. It brings together several technologies learned during the course. The student is challenged to query not just one web API, but three. Special attention should be given to the fact that the weatherbit API needs the data provided by the geonames API, which requires the student to have a keen knowledge of asynchronous functions. A bolder and neater design is also required, so mastering properties such as grid and flexbox in CSS is essential. Definitely the most inspiring project of the course.

## PROJECT'S GOAL

I believe that the objective of the project is to instigate the research of important concepts of webpack, javascript and HTML/CSS, making the student feel a little of the pleasure of being a front end programmer.
This travel application, although with few features, is fantastic. In it, the user types the name of a city, state or country, the date on which he intends to arrive at the destination and the departure date. From then on, when clicking on the “let’s go” button, several operations are performed.
The result is the presentation of splendid images of the chosen place, the calculation of how much time is left for the trip and information about the climate in the region.
